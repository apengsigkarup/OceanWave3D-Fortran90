 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00



 ZBB:  NRHS =   1

 All tests for ZBB passed the threshold ( 3000 tests run)


 ZBB:  NRHS =   2

 All tests for ZBB passed the threshold ( 3000 tests run)
