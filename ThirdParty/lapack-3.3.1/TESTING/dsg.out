 Tests of the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    NB:        1     3    20
    NBMIN:     2     2     2
    NX:        1     1     1

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00



 DSG:  NB =   1, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DSG passed the threshold (10290 tests run)


 DSG:  NB =   3, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DSG passed the threshold (10290 tests run)


 DSG:  NB =  20, NBMIN =   2, NX =   1

 All tests for DSG passed the threshold (10290 tests run)
