 SBD -- Real Singular Value Decomposition
 Matrix types (see xCHKBD for details):
 Diagonal matrices:
   1: Zero                             5: Clustered entries
   2: Identity                         6: Large, evenly spaced entries
   3: Evenly spaced entries            7: Small, evenly spaced entries
   4: Geometrically spaced entries
 General matrices:
   8: Evenly spaced sing. vals.       12: Small, evenly spaced sing vals
   9: Geometrically spaced sing vals  13: Random, O(1) entries
  10: Clustered sing. vals.           14: Random, scaled near overflow
  11: Large, evenly spaced sing vals  15: Random, scaled near underflow

 Test ratios:  (B: bidiagonal, S: diagonal, Q, P, U, and V: orthogonal
                X: m x nrhs, Y = Q' X, and Z = U' Y)
   1: norm( A - Q B P' ) / ( norm(A) max(m,n) ulp )
   2: norm( I - Q' Q )   / ( m ulp )
   3: norm( I - P' P )   / ( n ulp )
   4: norm( B - U S V' ) / ( norm(B) min(m,n) ulp )
   5: norm( Y - U Z )    / ( norm(Z) max(min(m,n),k) ulp )
   6: norm( I - U' U )   / ( min(m,n) ulp )
   7: norm( I - V' V )   / ( min(m,n) ulp )
   8: Test ordering of S  (0 if nondecreasing, 1/ulp  otherwise)
   9: norm( S - S2 )     / ( norm(S) ulp ), where S2 is computed
                                            without computing U and V'
  10: Sturm sequence test (0 if sing. vals of B within THRESH of S)
  11: norm( A - (QU) S (V' P') ) / ( norm(A) max(m,n) ulp )
  12: norm( X - (QU) Z )         / ( |X| max(M,k) ulp )
