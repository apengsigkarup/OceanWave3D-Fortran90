 Tests of the Nonsymmetric eigenproblem condition estimation routines
 CTRSYL, CTREXC, CTRSNA, CTRSEN

 Relative machine precision (EPS) =     0.119209E-06
 Safe minimum (SFMIN)             =     0.117549E-37

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 CEC routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 33 tests done)

 All tests for CEC routines passed the threshold (  5966 tests run)
