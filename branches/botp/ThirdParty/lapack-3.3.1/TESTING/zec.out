 Tests of the Nonsymmetric eigenproblem condition estimation routines
 ZTRSYL, CTREXC, CTRSNA, CTRSEN

 Relative machine precision (EPS) =     0.222045D-15
 Safe minimum (SFMIN)             =     0.222507-307

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 ZEC routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 33 tests done)

 All tests for ZEC routines passed the threshold (  5966 tests run)
