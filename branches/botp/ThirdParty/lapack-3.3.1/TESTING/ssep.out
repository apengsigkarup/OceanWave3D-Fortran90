 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    20
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    20
    NB:        1     3     3     3    10
    NBMIN:     2     2     2     2     2
    NX:        1     0     5     9     1

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   50.00

 SST -- Real Symmetric eigenvalue problem
 Matrix types (see SCHKST for details): 

 Special Matrices:
  1=Zero matrix.                          5=Diagonal: clustered entries.
  2=Identity matrix.                      6=Diagonal: large, evenly spaced.
  3=Diagonal: evenly spaced entries.      7=Diagonal: small, evenly spaced.
  4=Diagonal: geometr. spaced entries.
 Dense Symmetric Matrices:
  8=Evenly spaced eigenvals.             12=Small, evenly spaced eigenvals.
  9=Geometrically spaced eigenvals.      13=Matrix with random O(1) entries.
 10=Clustered eigenvalues.               14=Matrix with large random entries.
 11=Large, evenly spaced eigenvals.      15=Matrix with small random entries.
 16=Positive definite, evenly spaced eigenvalues
 17=Positive definite, geometrically spaced eigenvlaues
 18=Positive definite, clustered eigenvalues
 19=Positive definite, small evenly spaced eigenvalues
 20=Positive definite, large evenly spaced eigenvalues
 21=Diagonally dominant tridiagonal, geometrically spaced eigenvalues
