 Tests of the DOUBLE PRECISION LAPACK DSGESV/DSPOSV routines 
 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M   :       0     1     2    13    17    45    78    91   101   120
              132
    NRHS:       1     2    15    16

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   30.00

 Relative machine (single precision) underflow is taken to be    0.117549D-37
 Relative machine (single precision) overflow  is taken to be    0.340282D+39
 Relative machine (single precision) precision is taken to be    0.596046D-07

 Relative machine (double precision) underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine (double precision) overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine (double precision) precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15
