 Tests of the Generalized QR and RQ routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.1

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     3    10
    P:         0     5    20
    N:         0     3    30

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 GQR routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 12 tests done)

 All tests for GQR routines passed the threshold (  1728 tests run)
