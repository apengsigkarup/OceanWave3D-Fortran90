      SUBROUTINE MA28AD(N,NZ,A,LICN,IRN,LIRN,ICN,U,IKEEP,IW,W,IFLAG)
C THIS SUBROUTINE PERFORMS THE LU FACTORIZATION OF A.
C
C THE PARAMETERS ARE AS FOLLOWS.....
C N     ORDER OF MATRIX  NOT ALTERED BY SUBROUTINE.
C NZ    NUMBER OF NON-ZEROS IN INPUT MATRIX  NOT ALTERED BY SUBROUTINE.
C A IS A  REAL ARRAY  LENGTH LICN.  HOLDS NON-ZEROS OF MATRIX ON ENTRY
C     AND NON-ZEROS OF FACTORS ON EXIT.  REORDERED BY MC20A/AD AND
C     MC23A/AD AND ALTERED BY MA30A/AD.
C LICN  INTEGER  LENGTH OF ARRAYS A AND ICN.  NOT ALTERED BY SUBROUTINE.
C IRN   INTEGER ARRAY OF LENGTH LIRN.  HOLDS ROW INDICES ON INPUT.
C     USED AS WORKSPACE BY MA30A/AD TO HOLD COLUMN ORIENTATION OF
C     MATRIX.
C LIRN  INTEGER  LENGTH OF ARRAY IRN. NOT ALTERED BY THE SUBROUTINE.
C ICN   INTEGER ARRAY OF LENGTH LICN.  HOLDS COLUMN INDICES ON ENTRY
C     AND COLUMN INDICES OF DECOMPOSED MATRIX ON EXIT. REORDERED BY
C     MC20A/AD AND MC23A/AD AND ALTERED BY MA30A/AD.
C U     REAL VARIABLE  SET BY USER TO CONTROL BIAS TOWARDS NUMERIC OR
C     SPARSITY PIVOTING.  U=1.0 GIVES PARTIAL PIVOTING WHILE U=0. DOES
C     NOT CHECK MULTIPLIERS AT ALL.  VALUES OF U GREATER THAN ONE ARE
C     TREATED AS ONE WHILE NEGATIVE VALUES ARE TREATED AS ZERO.  NOT
C     ALTERED BY SUBROUTINE.
C IKEEP  INTEGER ARRAY OF LENGTH 5*N  USED AS WORKSPACE BY MA28A/AD
C     (SEE LATER COMMENTS).  IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE SET ON ENTRY
C     AND, ON EXIT, IT CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE DECOMPOSITION.
C     IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED BETWEEN THIS CALL AND SUBSEQUENT CALLS
C     TO MA28B/BD OR MA28C/CD.
C     IKEEP(I,1),I=1,N  HOLDS THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE PART OF ROW I
C     IN THE DIAGONAL BLOCK.
C     ROW IKEEP(I,2),I=1,N  OF THE INPUT MATRIX IS THE ITH ROW IN
C     PIVOT ORDER.
C     COLUMN IKEEP(I,3),I=1,N  OF THE INPUT MATRIX IS THE ITH COLUMN
C     IN PIVOT ORDER.
C     IKEEP(I,4),I=1,N  HOLDS THE LENGTH OF THE PART OF ROW I IN
C     THE L PART OF THE L/U DECOMPOSITION.
C     IKEEP(I,5),I=1,N  HOLDS THE LENGTH OF THE PART OF ROW I IN THE
C     OFF-DIAGONAL BLOCKS.  IF THERE IS ONLY ONE DIAGONAL BLOCK,
C     IKEEP(1,5) WILL BE SET TO -1.
C IW    INTEGER ARRAY OF LENGTH 8*N.  IF THE OPTION NSRCH.LE.N IS
C     USED, THEN THE LENGTH OF ARRAY IW CAN BE REDUCED TO 7*N.
C W REAL ARRAY  LENGTH N.  USED BY MC24A/AD BOTH AS WORKSPACE AND TO
C     RETURN GROWTH ESTIMATE IN W(1).  THE USE OF THIS ARRAY BY MA28A/AD
C     IS THUS OPTIONAL DEPENDING ON COMMON BLOCK LOGICAL VARIABLE GROW.
C IFLAG  INTEGER VARIABLE  USED AS ERROR FLAG BY ROUTINE.  A POSITIVE
C     OR ZERO VALUE ON EXIT INDICATES SUCCESS.  POSSIBLE NEGATIVE
C     VALUES ARE -1 THROUGH -14.
C

C     FOR ERROR MESSAGES AND DUPLICATE ELEMENT WARNING RESP.
C NLP,MLP  INTEGER  UNIT NUMBER FOR MESSAGES FROM MA30A/AD AND
C     MC23A/AD RESP.  SET BY MA28A/AD TO VALUE OF LP.
C LBLOCK  LOGICAL  DEFAULT VALUE TRUE.  IF TRUE MC23A/AD IS USED
C     TO FIRST PERMUTE THE MATRIX TO BLOCK LOWER TRIANGULAR FORM.
C GROW    LOGICAL  DEFAULT VALUE TRUE.  IF TRUE THEN AN ESTIMATE
C     OF THE INCREASE IN SIZE OF MATRIX ELEMENTS DURING L/U
C     DECOMPOSITION IS GIVEN BY MC24A/AD.
C EPS,RMIN,RESID  REAL/DOUBLE PRECISION VARIABLES NOT REFERENCED
C     BY MA28A/AD.

C     RESPECTIVELY, FOR SUCCESS ON FUTURE RUNS.
C IRANK  INTEGER   ESTIMATED RANK OF MATRIX.
C MIRNCP,MICNCP,MIRANK,MIRN,MICN INTEGER VARIABLES.  USED TO
C     COMMUNICATE BETWEEN MA30F/FD AND MA28F/FD VALUES OF ABOVENAMED
C     VARIABLES WITH SOMEWHAT SIMILAR NAMES.
C ABORT1,ABORT2  LOGICAL VARIABLES WITH DEFAULT VALUE TRUE.  IF FALSE
C     THEN DECOMPOSITION WILL BE PERFORMED EVEN IF THE MATRIX IS
C     STRUCTURALLY OR NUMERICALLY SINGULAR RESPECTIVELY.
C ABORTA,ABORTB  LOGICAL VARIABLES USED TO COMMUNICATE VALUES OF
C     ABORT1 AND ABORT2 TO MA30A/AD.
C ABORT  LOGICAL  USED TO COMMUNICATE VALUE OF ABORT1 TO MC23A/AD.
C ABORT3  LOGICAL VARIABLE NOT REFERENCED BY MA28A/AD.
C IDISP   INTEGER ARRAY  LENGTH 2.  USED TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION
C     ON DECOMPOSITION BETWEEN THIS CALL TO MA28A/AD AND SUBSEQUENT
C     CALLS TO MA28B/BD AND MA28C/CD.  ON EXIT, IDISP(1) AND
C     IDISP(2) INDICATE POSITION IN ARRAYS A AND ICN OF THE
C     FIRST AND LAST ELEMENTS IN THE L/U DECOMPOSITION OF THE
C     DIAGONAL BLOCKS, RESPECTIVELY.

      BLOCK DATA MA28JD
C
C COMMENTS ON ALL THE COMMON BLOCK VARIABLES ARE GIVEN HERE EVEN
C     THOUGH SOME ARE NOT INITIALIZED BY BLOCK DATA.
C LP,MP ARE USED BY THE SUBROUTINE AS THE UNIT NUMBERS FOR ITS WARNING
C     AND DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES. DEFAULT VALUE FOR BOTH IS 6 (FOR LINE
C     PRINTER OUTPUT). THE USER CAN EITHER RESET THEM TO A DIFFERENT
C     STREAM NUMBER OR SUPPRESS THE OUTPUT BY SETTING THEM TO ZERO.
C     WHILE LP DIRECTS THE OUTPUT OF ERROR DIAGNOSTICS FROM THE
C     PRINCIPAL SUBROUTINES AND INTERNALLY CALLED SUBROUTINES, MP
C     CONTROLS ONLY THE OUTPUT OF A MESSAGE WHICH WARNS THE USER THAT HE
C     HAS INPUT TWO OR MORE NON-ZEROS A(I), . . ,A(K) WITH THE SAME ROW
C     AND COLUMN INDICES.  THE ACTION TAKEN IN THIS CASE IS TO PROCEED
C     USING A NUMERICAL VALUE OF A(I)+...+A(K). IN THE ABSENCE OF OTHER
C     ERRORS, IFLAG WILL EQUAL -14 ON EXIT.
C LBLOCK IS A LOGICAL VARIABLE WHICH CONTROLS AN OPTION OF FIRST
C     PREORDERING THE MATRIX TO BLOCK LOWER TRIANGULAR FORM (USING
C     HARWELL SUBROUTINE MC23A). THE PREORDERING IS PERFORMED IF LBLOCK
C     IS EQUAL TO ITS DEFAULT VALUE OF .TRUE. IF LBLOCK IS SET TO
C     .FALSE. , THE OPTION IS NOT INVOKED AND THE SPACE ALLOCATED TO
C     IKEEP CAN BE REDUCED TO 4*N+1.
C GROW IS A LOGICAL VARIABLE. IF IT IS LEFT AT ITS DEFAULT VALUE OF
C     .TRUE. , THEN ON RETURN FROM MA28A/AD OR MA28B/BD, W(1) WILL GIVE
C     AN ESTIMATE (AN UPPER BOUND) OF THE INCREASE IN SIZE OF ELEMENTS
C     ENCOUNTERED DURING THE DECOMPOSITION. IF THE MATRIX IS WELL
C     SCALED, THEN A HIGH VALUE FOR W(1), RELATIVE TO THE LARGEST ENTRY
C     IN THE INPUT MATRIX, INDICATES THAT THE LU DECOMPOSITION MAY BE
C     INACCURATE AND THE USER SHOULD BE WARY OF HIS RESULTS AND PERHAPS
C     INCREASE U FOR SUBSEQUENT RUNS.  WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT
C     THIS VALUE ONLY RELATES TO THE ACCURACY OF OUR LU DECOMPOSITION
C     AND GIVES NO INDICATION AS TO THE SINGULARITY OF THE MATRIX OR THE
C     ACCURACY OF THE SOLUTION.  THIS UPPER BOUND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT
C     OVERESTIMATE PARTICULARLY IF THE MATRIX IS BADLY SCALED. IF AN
C     ACCURATE VALUE FOR THE GROWTH IS REQUIRED, LBIG (Q.V.) SHOULD BE
C     SET TO .TRUE.
C EPS,RMIN ARE REAL VARIABLES. IF, ON ENTRY TO MA28B/BD, EPS IS LESS
C     THAN ONE, THEN RMIN WILL GIVE THE SMALLEST RATIO OF THE PIVOT TO
C     THE LARGEST ELEMENT IN THE CORRESPONDING ROW OF THE UPPER
C     TRIANGULAR FACTOR THUS MONITORING THE STABILITY OF SUCCESSIVE
C     FACTORIZATIONS. IF RMIN BECOMES VERY LARGE AND W(1) FROM
C     MA28B/BD IS ALSO VERY LARGE, IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO PERFORM A
C     NEW DECOMPOSITION USING MA28A/AD.
C RESID IS A REAL VARIABLE WHICH ON EXIT FROM MA28C/CD GIVES THE VALUE
C     OF THE MAXIMUM RESIDUAL OVER ALL THE EQUATIONS UNSATISFIED BECAUSE
C     OF DEPENDENCY (ZERO PIVOTS).
C IRNCP,ICNCP ARE INTEGER VARIABLES WHICH MONITOR THE ADEQUACY OF "ELBOW
C     ROOM" IN IRN AND A/ICN RESPECTIVELY. IF EITHER IS QUITE LARGE (SAY
C     GREATER THAN N/10), IT WILL PROBABLY PAY TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF
C     THE CORRESPONDING ARRAY FOR SUBSEQUENT RUNS. IF EITHER IS VERY LOW
C     OR ZERO THEN ONE CAN PERHAPS SAVE STORAGE BY REDUCING THE SIZE OF
C     THE CORRESPONDING ARRAY.
C MINIRN,MINICN ARE INTEGER VARIABLES WHICH, IN THE EVENT OF A
C     SUCCESSFUL RETURN (IFLAG GE 0 OR IFLAG=-14) GIVE THE MINIMUM SIZE
C     OF IRN AND A/ICN RESPECTIVELY WHICH WOULD ENABLE A SUCCESSFUL RUN
C     ON AN IDENTICAL MATRIX. ON AN EXIT WITH IFLAG EQUAL TO -5, MINICN
C     GIVES THE MINIMUM VALUE OF ICN FOR SUCCESS ON SUBSEQUENT RUNS ON
C     AN IDENTICAL MATRIX. IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE WITH IFLAG= -6, -4,
C     -3, -2, OR -1, THEN MINICN AND MINIRN GIVE THE MINIMUM VALUE OF
C     LICN AND LIRN RESPECTIVELY WHICH WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR A
C     SUCCESSFUL DECOMPOSITION UP TO THE POINT AT WHICH THE FAILURE
C     OCCURRED.
C IRANK IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE WHICH GIVES AN UPPER BOUND ON THE RANK OF
C     THE MATRIX.
C ABORT1 IS A LOGICAL VARIABLE WITH DEFAULT VALUE .TRUE.  IF ABORT1 IS
C     SET TO .FALSE.  THEN MA28A/AD WILL DECOMPOSE STRUCTURALLY SINGULAR
C     MATRICES (INCLUDING RECTANGULAR ONES).
C ABORT2 IS A LOGICAL VARIABLE WITH DEFAULT VALUE .TRUE.  IF ABORT2 IS
C     SET TO .FALSE. THEN MA28A/AD WILL DECOMPOSE NUMERICALLY SINGULAR
C     MATRICES.
C IDISP IS AN INTEGER ARRAY OF LENGTH 2. ON OUTPUT FROM MA28A/AD, THE
C     INDICES OF THE DIAGONAL BLOCKS OF THE FACTORS LIE IN POSITIONS
C     IDISP(1) TO IDISP(2) OF A/ICN. THIS ARRAY MUST BE PRESERVED
C     BETWEEN A CALL TO MA28A/AD AND SUBSEQUENT CALLS TO MA28B/BD,
C     MA28C/CD OR MA28I/ID.
C TOL IS A REAL VARIABLE.  IF IT IS SET TO A POSITIVE VALUE, THEN ANY
C     NON-ZERO WHOSE MODULUS IS LESS THAN TOL WILL BE DROPPED FROM THE
C     FACTORIZATION.  THE FACTORIZATION WILL THEN REQUIRE LESS STORAGE
C     BUT WILL BE INACCURATE.  AFTER A RUN OF MA28A/AD WITH TOL POSITIVE
C     IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO USE MA28B/BD AND THE USER IS RECOMMENDED TO
C     USE MA28I/ID TO OBTAIN THE SOLUTION.  THE DEFAULT VALUE FOR TOL IS
C     0.0.
C THEMAX IS A REAL VARIABLE.  ON EXIT FROM MA28A/AD, IT WILL HOLD THE
C     LARGEST ENTRY OF THE ORIGINAL MATRIX.
C BIG IS A REAL VARIABLE. IF LBIG HAS BEEN SET TO .TRUE., BIG WILL HOLD
C     THE LARGEST ENTRY ENCOUNTERED DURING THE FACTORIZATION BY MA28A/AD
C     OR MA28B/BD.
C DXMAX IS A REAL VARIABLE. ON EXIT FROM MA28I/ID, DXMAX WILL BE SET TO
C     THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE SOLUTION.
C ERRMAX IS A REAL VARIABLE.  ON EXIT FROM MA28I/ID, IF MAXIT IS
C     POSITIVE, ERRMAX WILL BE SET TO THE LARGEST COMPONENT IN THE
C     ESTIMATE OF THE ERROR.
C DRES IS A REAL VARIABLE.  ON EXIT FROM MA28I/ID, IF MAXIT IS POSITIVE,
C     DRES WILL BE SET TO THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE RESIDUAL.
C CGCE IS A REAL VARIABLE. IT IS USED BY MA28I/ID TO CHECK THE
C     CONVERGENCE RATE.  IF THE RATIO OF SUCCESSIVE CORRECTIONS IS
C     NOT LESS THAN CGCE THEN WE TERMINATE SINCE THE CONVERGENCE
C     RATE IS ADJUDGED TOO SLOW.
C NDROP IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE. IF TOL HAS BEEN SET POSITIVE, ON EXIT
C     FROM MA28A/AD, NDROP WILL HOLD THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES DROPPED FROM
C     THE DATA STRUCTURE.
C MAXIT IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE. IT IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITERATIONS
C     PERFORMED BY MA28I/ID. IT HAS A DEFAULT VALUE OF 16.
C NOITER IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE. IT IS SET BY MA28I/ID TO THE NUMBER OF
C     ITERATIVE REFINEMENT ITERATIONS ACTUALLY USED.
C NSRCH IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE. IF NSRCH IS SET TO A VALUE LESS THAN N,
C     THEN A DIFFERENT PIVOT OPTION WILL BE EMPLOYED BY MA28A/AD.  THIS
C     MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENT FILL-IN AND EXECUTION TIME FOR MA28A/AD.
C     IF NSRCH IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO N, THE WORKSPACE ARRAY IW CAN BE
C     REDUCED IN LENGTH.  THE DEFAULT VALUE FOR NSRCH IS 32768.
C ISTART IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE. IF ISTART IS SET TO A VALUE OTHER THAN
C     ZERO, THEN THE USER MUST SUPPLY AN ESTIMATE OF THE SOLUTION TO
C     MA28I/ID.  THE DEFAULT VALUE FOR ISTART IS ZERO.
C LBIG IS A LOGICAL VARIABLE. IF LBIG IS SET TO .TRUE., THE VALUE OF THE
C     LARGEST ELEMENT ENCOUNTERED IN THE FACTORIZATION BY MA28A/AD OR
C     MA28B/BD IS RETURNED IN BIG.  SETTING LBIG TO .TRUE.  WILL
C     INCREASE THE TIME FOR MA28A/AD MARGINALLY AND THAT FOR MA28B/BD
C     BY ABOUT 20%.  THE DEFAULT VALUE FOR LBIG IS .FALSE.
